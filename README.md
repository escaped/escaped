you stumbled onto my profile and, I don't wanna be rude, so I guess I introduce myself:

I am Alex, an experienced software engineer, who gained various skills over the last decades.
I love to code, solve difficult bugs and support others by sharing my knowledge or helping them as much as I can.
That's why I provide **Open Office Hours** to anyone interested.
Feel free to [book a time slot](https://go.oncehub.com/escaped) (free-of-charge).
